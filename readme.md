# `kpass`

Command line interface to keepass databases.

## Usage

```
kpass ~/path/to/my/db.kdbx

You'll be prompted for your full password.

After you've unlocked it subsequent unlocks can be accomplished by a quick password (the last 3 chars of your full password). A single failure will then prompt for the full password.
